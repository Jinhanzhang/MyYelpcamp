# MyYelpcamp

Yelpcamp is a course project from [Udemy The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
  This project is a customized version of the original project developed during the course. 

  To set up a development environment for this project, first install all the npm dependencies:

```
    npm install
```

  To seed your local MongoDB database, run
```
    node seeds
```

   Since the project makes use of Cloudinary, Mapbox, and Unsplash, you need to register accounts for these services and configure your own user info and credentials in `.env` file.
